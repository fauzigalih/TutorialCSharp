            /* float and double are floating binary point types. In other words, they represent a number like this:

             * The binary number and the location of the binary point are both encoded within the value.
             * 
             * decimal is a floating decimal point type. In other words, they represent a number like this:
             * 12345.65789
             * Again, the number and the location of the decimal point are both encoded within the value â€“ 
             * that's what makes decimal still a floating point type instead of a fixed point type.
